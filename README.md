# How to test your applications: Testing a digital goods store

## Introduction

In this part, we will learn to test our React + TypeScript applications.

We will use React testing library because it has simple API, is easy to set up and is recommended by React team. Oh, and of course it supports TypeScript.

How to test a front-end application isn't always obvious, but the React testing library makes it easy.
Below, we're going to walk through how to test components in React with Jest, how to mock dependencies, test routing, and even test React hooks.

<br />

## Install the dependencies and launch the app:

```bash
npm i && npm run dev
```

`The npm run dev command runs both a server and a client. We use concurrently to launch two scripts at the same time. You can check src/package.json to see how we do it.`

<br />
<br />

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
